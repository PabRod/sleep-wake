abstract = {The human circadian timing system has previously been shown to free run with a period slightly longer than 24 h in subjects living in the laboratory under conditions of forced desynchrony. In forced desynchrony, subjects are shielded from bright light and periodic time cues and are required to live on a day length outside the range of circadian entrainment. The work schedule used for most personnel aboard American submarines is 6 h on duty alternating with 12 h off duty. This imposed 18-h cycle is too short for human circadian synchronization , especially given that there is no bright-light exposure aboard submarines. However, crew members are exposed to 24-h stimuli that could mediate synchronization , such as clocks and social contacts with personnel who are living on a 24-h schedule. The authors investigated circadian rhythms of salivary mela-tonin in 20 crew members during a prolonged voyage on a Trident nuclear submarine. The authors found that in crew members living on the 18-h duty cycle, the endogenous rhythm of melatonin showed an average period of 24.35 h (n = 12, SD = 0.18 h). These data indicate that social contacts and knowledge of clock time are insufficient for entrainment to a 24-h period in personnel living by an 18-h rest-activity cycle aboard a submarine.},

@article{Borbely2016,
abstract = {In the last three decades the two-process model of sleep regulation has served as a major conceptual framework in sleep research. It has been applied widely in studies on fatigue and performance and to dissect individual differences in sleep regulation. The model posits that a homeostatic process (Process S) interacts with a process controlled by the circadian pacemaker (Process C), with time-courses derived from physiological and behavioural variables. The model simulates successfully the timing and intensity of sleep in diverse experimental protocols. Electrophysiological recordings from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) suggest that S and C interact continuously. Oscillators outside the SCN that are linked to energy metabolism are evident in SCN-lesioned arrhythmic animals subjected to restricted feeding or methamphetamine administration, as well as in human subjects during internal desynchronization. In intact animals these peripheral oscillators may dissociate from the central pacemaker rhythm. A sleep/fast and wake/feed phase segregate antagonistic anabolic and catabolic metabolic processes in peripheral tissues. A deficiency of Process S was proposed to account for both depressive sleep disturbances and the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation. The model supported the development of novel non-pharmacological treatment paradigms in psychiatry, based on manipulating circadian phase, sleep and light exposure. In conclusion, the model remains conceptually useful for promoting the integration of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Sleep appears to have not only a short-term, use-dependent function; it also serves to enforce rest and fasting, thereby supporting the optimization of metabolic processes at the appropriate phase of the 24-h cycle.},

@article{Phillips2007,
abstract = {A quantitative, physiology-based model of the ascending arousal system is developed, using continuum neuronal population modeling, which involves averaging properties such as firing rates across neurons in each population. The model includes the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), where circadian and homeostatic drives enter the system, the monoaminergic and cholinergic nuclei of the ascending arousal system, and their interconnections. The human sleep-wake cycle is governed by the activities of these nuclei, which modulate the behavioral state of the brain via diffuse neuromodulatory projections. The model parameters are not free since they correspond to physiological observables. Approximate parameter bounds are obtained by requiring consistency with physiological and behavioral measures, and the model replicates the human sleep-wake cycle, with physiologically reasonable voltages and firing rates. Mutual inhibition between the wake-promoting monoaminergic group and sleep-promoting VLPO causes ''flip-flop'' behavior, with most time spent in 2 stable steady states corresponding to wake and sleep, with transitions between them on a timescale of a few minutes. The model predicts hysteresis in the sleep-wake cycle, with a region of bistability of the wake and sleep states. Reducing the monoaminergic-VLPO mutual inhibition results in a smaller hysteresis loop. This makes the model more prone to wake-sleep transitions in both directions and makes the states less distin-guishable, as in narcolepsy. The model behavior is robust across the constrained parameter ranges, but with sufficient flexibility to describe a wide range of observed phenomena.},

@article{Daan1984,
abstract = {A model for the timing of human sleep is presented. It is based on a sleep-regulating variable (S)--possibly, but not necessarily, associated with a neurochemical substance--which increases during wakefulness and decreases during sleep. Sleep onset is triggered when S approaches an upper threshold (H); awakening occurs when S reaches a lower threshold (L). The thresholds show a circadian rhythm controlled by a single circadian pacemaker. Time constants of the S process were derived from rates of change of electroencephalographic (EEG) power density during regular sleep and during recovery from sleep deprivation. The waveform of the circadian threshold fluctuations was derived from spontaneous wake-up times after partial sleep deprivation. The model allows computer simulations of the main phenomena of human sleep timing, such as 1) internal desynchronization in the absence of time cues, 2) sleep fragmentation during continuous bed rest, and 3) circadian phase dependence of sleep duration during isolation from time cues, recovery from sleep deprivation, and shift work. The model shows that the experimental data are consistent with the concept of a single circadian pacemaker in humans. It has implications for the understanding of sleep as a restorative process and its timing with respect to day and night.},

@article{Phillips2011,
abstract = {Early attempts to characterize free-running human circadian rhythms generated three notable results: 1) observed circadian periods of 25 hours (considerably longer than the now established 24.1- to 24.2-hour average intrinsic circadian period) with sleep delayed to later circadian phases than during entrainment; 2) spontaneous internal desynchrony of circadian rhythms and sleep/wake cycles--the former with an approximately 24.9-hour period, and the latter with a longer (28-68 hour) or shorter (12-20 hour) period; and 3) bicircadian (48-50 hour) sleep/wake cycles. All three results are reproduced by Kronauer et al.'s (1982) coupled oscillator model, but the physiological basis for that phenomenological model is unclear. We use a physiologically based model of hypothalamic and brain stem nuclei to investigate alternative physiological mechanisms that could underlie internal desynchrony. We demonstrate that experimental observations can be reproduced by changes in two pathways: promotion of orexinergic (Orx) wake signals, and attenuation of the circadian signal reaching hypothalamic nuclei. We reason that delayed sleep is indicative of an additional wake-promoting drive, which may be of behavioral origin, associated with removal of daily schedules and instructions given to participants. We model this by increasing Orx tone during wake, which reproduces the observed period lengthening and delayed sleep. Weakening circadian input to the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (possibly mediated by the dorsomedial hypothalamus) causes desynchrony, with observed sleep/wake cycle period determined by degree of Orx up-regulation. During desynchrony, sleep/wake cycles are driven by sleep homeostasis, yet sleep bout length maintains circadian phase dependence. The model predicts sleep episodes are shortest when started near the temperature minimum, consistent with experimental findings. The model also correctly predicts that it is possible to transition to bicircadian rhythms from either a synchronized or desynchronized state. Our findings suggest that feedback from behavioral choices to physiology could play an important role in spontaneous internal desynchrony.},

@article{Fulcher2014,
abstract = {The orexinergic neurons of the lateral hypothalamus (Orx) are essential for regulating sleep-wake dynamics, and their loss causes narcolepsy, a disorder characterized by severe instability of sleep and wake states. However, the mechanisms through which Orx stabilize sleep and wake are not well understood. In this work, an explanation of the stabilizing effects of Orx is presented using a quantitative model of important physiological connections between Orx and the sleep-wake switch. In addition to Orx and the sleep-wake switch, which is composed of mutually inhibitory wake-active monoaminergic neurons in brainstem and hypothalamus (MA) and the sleep-active ventrolateral preoptic neurons of the hypothalamus (VLPO), the model also includes the circadian and homeostatic sleep drives. It is shown that Orx stabilizes prolonged waking episodes via its excitatory input to MA and by relaying a circadian input to MA, thus sustaining MA firing activity during the circadian day. During sleep, both Orx and MA are inhibited by the VLPO, and the subsequent reduction in Orx input to the MA indirectly stabilizes sustained sleep episodes. Simulating a loss of Orx, the model produces dynamics resembling narcolepsy, including frequent transitions between states, reduced waking arousal levels, and a normal daily amount of total sleep. The model predicts a change in sleep timing with differences in orexin levels, with higher orexin levels delaying the normal sleep episode, suggesting that individual differences in Orx signaling may contribute to chronotype. Dynamics resembling sleep inertia also emerge from the model as a gradual sleep-to-wake transition on a timescale that varies with that of Orx dynamics. The quantitative, physiologically based model developed in this work thus provides a new explanation of how Orx stabilizes prolonged episodes of sleep and wake, and makes a range of experimentally testable predictions, including a role for Orx in chronotype and sleep inertia.},

@article{Skeldon2014,
abstract = {Sleep is essential for the maintenance of the brain and the body, yet many features of sleep are poorly understood and mathematical models are an important tool for probing proposed biological mechanisms. The most well-known mathematical model of sleep regulation, the two-process model, models the sleep-wake cycle by two oscillators: a circadian oscillator and a homeostatic oscillator. An alternative, more recent, model considers the mutual inhibition of sleep promoting neurons and the ascending arousal system regulated by homeostatic and circadian processes. Here we show there are fundamental similarities between these two models. The implications are illustrated with two important sleep-wake phenomena. Firstly, we show that in the two-process model, transitions between different numbers of daily sleep episodes can be classified as grazing bifurcations. This provides the theoretical underpinning for numerical results showing that the sleep patterns of many mammals can be explained by the mutual inhibition model. Secondly, we show that when sleep deprivation disrupts the sleep-wake cycle, ostensibly different measures of sleepiness in the two models are closely related. The demonstration of the mathematical similarities of the two models is valuable because not only does it allow some features of the two-process model to be interpreted physiologically but it also means that knowledge gained from study of the two-process model can be used to inform understanding of the behaviour of the mutual inhibition model. This is important because the mutual inhibition model and its extensions are increasingly being used as a tool to understand a diverse range of sleep-wake phenomena such as the design of optimal shift-patterns, yet the values it uses for parameters associated with the circadian and homeostatic processes are very different from those that have been experimentally measured in the context of the two-process model.},

abstract = {We describe differences between synchronisation and resonance, and analyse different types of nonlinear resonances in a weakly damped Duffing oscillator using bifurcation theory techniques. In addition to previously reported (i) odd subharmonic resonances found on the primary branch of symmetric periodic solutions with the forcing frequency and (ii) even subharmonic resonances due to symmetry-broken periodic solutions that bifurcate off the primary branch and also oscillate at the forcing frequency, we uncover (iii) novel resonance type due to isolas of periodic solutions that are not connected to the primary branch. These occur between odd and even resonances, oscillate at a fraction of the forcing frequency, and give rise to a complicated resonance ‘curve' with disconnected elements and high degree of multistability. We use bifurcation continuation to compute resonance tongues in the plane of the forcing frequency vs. the forcing amplitude for different but fixed values of the damping rate. Our analysis shows that identified here isolated resonances explain the intriguing “intermingled tongues” that were observed for weak damping and misinterpreted as (synchronisation) Arnold tongues in Paar and Pavin (1998). What is more, isolated resonances link “intermingled tongues” to a seemingly unrelated phenomenon of “bifurcation superstructure” described for moderate damping in Parlitz and Lauterborn (1985).},

The most successful approach to describe how coherent behavior emerges in these complex systems is given by the paradigmatic Kuramoto model. This model has been traditionally studied in complete graphs. However, besides being intrinsically dynamical, complex systems present very heterogeneous structure, which can be represented as complex networks. This report is dedicated to review main contributions in the field of synchronization in networks of Kuramoto oscillators. In particular, we provide an overview of the impact of network patterns on the local and global dynamics of coupled phase oscillators. We cover many relevant topics, which encompass a description of the most used analytical approaches and the analysis of several numerical results. Furthermore, we discuss recent developments on variations of the Kuramoto model in networks, including the presence of noise and inertia. The rich potential for applications is discussed for special fields in engineering, neuroscience, physics and Earth science. Finally, we conclude by discussing problems that remain open after the last decade of intensive research on the Kuramoto model and point out some promising directions for future research.},

The question here raised is, “What modes of temporal organization—if any—could result from weak interactions in a population of innately oscillatory devices (e.g. electronic oscillators, secretory cells, spontaneously active neurons, or individual animals)?” By mathematical analysis, electronic experiments, and digital computer simulation, answers are found as functions of the nature of the periodic processes and the kind of interactions involved. For populations of “generalized relaxation oscillators”, threshold conditions are discovered for mutual synchronization in any of a variety of modes.

The model relaxation oscillator consists of a one-dimensional flow with jump conditions and is motivated by earlier studies of the flow on the slow manifold of a piecewise-linear relaxation oscillator. The results are obtained by studying the dynamics of the phase mapping which describes how the forcing phase varies between jumps.},

@article{Strogatz2000,
abstract = {The Kuramoto model describes a large population of coupled limit-cycle oscillators whose natural frequencies are drawn from some prescribed distribution. If the coupling strength exceeds a certain threshold, the system exhibits a phase transition: some of the oscillators spontaneously synchronize, while others remain incoherent. The mathematical analysis of this bifurcation has proved both problematic and fascinating. We review 25 years of research on the Kuramoto model, highlighting the false turns as well as the successes, but mainly following the trail leading from Kuramoto's work to Crawford's recent contributions. It is a lovely winding road, with excursions through mathematical biology, statistical physics, kinetic theory, bifurcation theory, and plasma physics.},

@misc{Strogatz1993,
abstract = {Arrays of identical limit-cycle oscillators have been used to model a wide variety of pattern-forming systems, such as neural networks, convecting fluids, laser arrays and coupled biochemical oscillators. These systems are known to exhibit rich collective behavior, from synchrony and traveling waves to spatiotemporal chaos and incoherence. Recently, Kuramoto and his colleagues reported a strange new mode of organization here called the chimera state in which coherence and incoherence exist side by side in the same system of oscillators. Such states have never been seen in systems with either local or global coupling; they are apparently peculiar to the intermediate case of nonlocal coupling. Here we give an exact solution for the chimera state, for a one-dimensional ring of phase oscillators coupled nonlocally by a cosine kernel. The analysis reveals that the chimera is born in a continuous bifurcation from a spatially modulated drift state, and dies in a saddle-node collision with an unstable version of itself.},
